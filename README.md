# Homework5
For this homework I want to create a regular schedule for working day. 
---
* At first I need to create all the timeblocks in the HTML, added all the information for the time and textarea and a save button at the end of the row.
---
* Working in the JavaScript:

1. Refences the heading of the page when it run, it shows the title and the current time-date-month-year for the page. 
---
2. And, I refences all the timeblocks that I have created in the HTML by setting up array for them.
---
3. For the timeblock color I create them in the HTML with the textarea by added past-present-future in front of the column, so it will change the color separately in each period of time.
---
4. And, into the timeblock area I can enter the event that I have to do in it and save it in the local storage. Even, when I refresh the page all the events still persist.
